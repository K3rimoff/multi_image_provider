✅ Supports SVG images from assets and network (flutter_svg + caching)

✅ Custom aspect ratio control

✅ Border radius and decoration support

✅ Placeholder and error widgets for network images
## 🚀Installation
Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
  dependencies:
  multi_image_provider: ^1.0.0
```
Then run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```
## 🛠️Usage
```dart
import 'package:multi_image_provider/multi_image_provider.dart';

MultiImage(
  imagePath: 'assets/images/sample.png',
  imageType: ImageType.asset,
  aspectRatio: 382 / 500,
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
)
```

## 🌐For network images:
```dart
MultiImage(
  imagePath: 'https://picsum.photos/400/600',
  imageType: ImageType.network,
  aspectRatio: 382 / 500,
  width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.9,
  placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
)
```
## 📌Notes
⚠️ Currently, the package does not support the Web platform due to dependency on `flutter_cache_manager` and `path_provider`.

Works on Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

Does not support Web or WASM runtimes due to underlying dependencies.
